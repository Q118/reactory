For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. 

This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, 
manage component state, 
and respond to user events.

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.


An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. 
It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.


Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:
        Sort the table by at least one category
        Filter the users by at least one property.


work flow:
        API running, search query
            decide on an APi: just need to searcg and sort by at least one category
            OMDB: 

        generate layout hardcode the table first
            table columns: picture, id, title, director, release date
        sort by: director or title*


        code to dynamically render
